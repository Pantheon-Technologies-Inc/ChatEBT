# Fixes Applied - File Upload & Logging

## âœ… Fix 1: PDF Support for Agents Endpoint

**File**: `api/server/controllers/agents/client.js`
**Issue**: PDFs were uploaded but not sent to the AI (only 38 tokens instead of thousands)
**Root Cause**: `encodeAndFormat()` only handles images (files with `height` property). PDFs have no height, so they were skipped.

**Solution**: Added code in `addImageURLs()` method to:
1. Detect PDFs that were skipped by `encodeAndFormat()`
2. Read them from disk and convert to base64
3. Add them to `image_urls` array so vision models can process them

**Expected Result**: After restart, you should see:
```
[AgentClient] Added PDF ARES - Investor Deck.pdf for vision API (XXXkB)
```

And the token count should jump from 38 to thousands (depending on PDF size).

## âœ… Fix 2: Reduced ARES Logging

**Files Modified**:
- `api/models/Transaction.js`
- `api/models/balanceMethods.js`
- `api/utils/aresClient.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed verbose multi-line debug boxes
- Converted routine operations to `logger.debug()` instead of `console.log()` or `logger.info()`
- Kept important events at `info` level (errors, auth issues, etc.)

**Before**:
```
ðŸ”¥ ===== ARES CREDIT CALCULATION DEBUG =====
User: 688bc18f1abeea6160a92968
Token Type: prompt
Model: gpt-5
Context: message
Raw Token Amount: -12
Absolute Tokens: 12
USD Rate: $1.25 per 1M tokens
Token Value (ARES Credits): -0.0075
... (20 more lines)
===============================================
```

**After**:
```
[ARES] prompt: 12 tokens â†’ 1 credits ($0.0020)
[ARES] âœ“ Deducted 1 credits
```

## Testing Checklist

1. **Restart server** (required for changes to take effect)
   ```bash
   cd api
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Upload the PDF** - ARES - Investor Deck.pdf

3. **Send message** - "tell me about this investor deck"

4. **Check logs for**:
   - âœ… `[AgentClient] Added PDF ARES - Investor Deck.pdf for vision API`
   - âœ… Token count should be thousands (not 38)
   - âœ… Much less ARES logging spam
   - âœ… AI should respond with PDF content

---

## What Was NOT Changed

- OpenAI Responses API migration code (still in place, but agents don't use it)
- File upload UI (still works fine)
- ARES credit calculation logic (only logging was reduced)

---

## If It Still Doesn't Work

### Check 1: File path accessible?
```bash
ls -la /path/to/uploaded/file.pdf
```

### Check 2: Vision model configured?
The model must support vision (gpt-4, gpt-4o, gpt-5, etc.)

### Check 3: Server restarted?
The changes won't take effect until restart

### Check 4: Any errors in logs?
Look for:
- `[AgentClient] Error reading PDF`
- File permission errors
- Model errors
